Decision Pipeline
=================

# Introduction

The Decision Pipeline is a mechanism for representing the progress of all member-level decisions from early-stage refinement work through to acceptance or rejection by the Membership.

The Decision Pipeline consists of three linked things:

1. An **agile board** that tracks individual decisions from beginning to end as tickets.
2. A **reciprocal agreement** that 'decision sponsors' will provide regular updates on the progress and substance of decisions, while Members will stay up-to-date with progress and engage with the substance of decisions when needed.
3. A **conceptual framework** that describes how decisions progress, comprising decision statuses, roles and responsibilities, and tasks and activities.

# Principles

The Decision Pipeline is based on the following principles:

The Decision Pipeline is **opinionated and prescriptive** about a small number of things:

- Ensuring that decisions in progress are visible. 
- Standardising how the progress of decisions is represented and updated.
- Naming and assigning responsibilities and expectations.

The Decision Pipeline is **unopinionated and flexible** about a larger number of things, including:

- How work on decisions is organised and progressed.
- How decisions are made.
- How proposals are presented to members.

At the same time, the Decision Pipeline provides a conceptual framework for both understanding decision-making as it is currently practised and for changing those practices in the future. It does this by:

- Representing the activities that go into shaping, progressing and resolving a decision.
- Documenting a lack of standardisation, documentation or agreement where appropriate.
- Building in review and revision of the product, processes and activities to named responsibilities.
