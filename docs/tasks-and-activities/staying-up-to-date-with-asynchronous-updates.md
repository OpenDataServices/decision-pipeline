Staying up-to-date with decisions
=================================

```{warning} Much of the Decision Pipeline documentation can be considered as guidance or as a framework for visualising how decision-making happens.

The sections on providing and engaging with updates are much more prescriptive. The agreement that transparency will be reciprocated with timely engagement is an implicit principle of collective management and is built into the design of the decision pipeline.      
```

Reading updates on decision progress is important for progressing decisions, strengthening democratic member control and holding effective meetings. It is expected that members will read updates before the pipeline review meeting, and as requested for decisions that need urgent attention.

## Reading regular updates

Members MUST:

- Read asynchronous updates provided in advance of the fortnightly meeting.
- Read any highlighted changes to a decision summary and any specified supporting information.

```{note} **Example decision update**: increasing basic pay<br>

A decision facilitator issues the following update:

> We have prepared a budget showing the impact of the proposed pay rise. This information has been added to the decision summary. The full budget is available as optional supporting information.

Members should read the updated decision summary and may choose to read the full budget.

```

## Decision updates: what to expect

Updates will be sent according to the pipeline review timetable:
