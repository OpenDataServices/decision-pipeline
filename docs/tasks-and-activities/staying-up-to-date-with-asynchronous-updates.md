Staying up-to-date with asynchronous updates
============================================

Members MUST read asynchronous updates and relevant supporting material provided by the decision sponsor.

Updates will be provided the day before the fortnightly co-op meeting and MUST be read before the meeting itself.

In general:

- Early stage decisions will provide summary information only.
- Decisions at a more advanced stage MAY provide supporting material. 
- Supporting material SHOULD be tailored to the complexity and potential impact of the decision.
- Supporting material SHOULD be digestible and useful to members in making the right decision.
