Providing updates on decision progress
======================================

```{warning} Much of the Decision Pipeline documentation can be considered as guidance or as a framework for visualising how decision-making happens.

The sections on providing and engaging with updates are much more prescriptive. The agreement that transparency will be reciprocated with timely engagement is an implicit principle of collective management and is built into the design of the decision pipeline.      
```

Sending regular and timely updates on decision progress is important for building awareness, strengthening democratic member control and holding effective meetings. 

## Sending regular updates

Decision facilitators MUST:

- Send an update on a decision in advance of every fortnightly team meeting if relevant progress or change needs to be reported, or if requested to do so.

### How to provide an update on a decision

1. Update the decision summary and relevant fields in the decision ticket with relevant information.
2. Add an update to the relevant decision ticket that describes the changes, including pointers to any supporting information. Be explicit if members are expected to read the supporting information.
4. Make sure that the ticket is assigned to Members.

## When to send an update

### Timetable

Updates should be sent according to the pipeline review timetable:
