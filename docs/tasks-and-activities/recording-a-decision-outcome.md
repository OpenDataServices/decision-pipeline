Recording a decision outcome
============================

## How to record a decision outcome

1. Check that the "Decision Link" field points to the issue, poll or document heading where a decision was made.
2. Check that the "Decision End Date" matches the date that the decision was made.
3. Update the decision ticket to state whether the decision was accepted or rejected, with a description and further details if needed. 
4. Complete all {ref}`wrap up<wrap_up>` work. 
5. Update the status to "Accepted" or "Rejected".

## Examining record outcomes

Decisions can be queried to create a {ref}`decision_register` of previous decisions and decisions that were rejected, withdrawn or delegated.
