Creating spaces for education and feedback
==========================================

``` {warning}
There is no standardised way of engaging with members to inform them about the substance of decisions or to gather wider needs and incorporate feedback. The following information is offered as guidance. <br><br>The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.
```

Decision facilitators may consider:

- Adding an agenda item to the pipeline review for a newly identified emerging decision, in order to introduce members to the idea, identify potential interest decision team members and to gather rapid feedback.
- Facilitating a session to discover stakeholders or key user needs.
- Doing a quick show-and-tell of work-in-progress proposals or supporting information.
- Having an open session during co-working.
- Temperature check polls.
- Arranging drop-in sessions to answer questions.
- Creating and maintaining an FAQ.
