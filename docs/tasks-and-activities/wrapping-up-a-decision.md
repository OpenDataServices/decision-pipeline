Wrapping up a decision
======================

## How to wrap up a decision

1. Set the status of the ticket to wrap up.
2. Record the work that needs to be done to wrap the decision up, either in the decision ticket or separately.
3. Complete the wrap up work and document that it has been done.
4. Update the decision ticket and change the status to "Accepted" or "Rejected". 

## Identifying wrap up work

The outcome of a decision MAY REQUIRE documentation or other information management work, or result in a mandate or initiation of further work, 

The decision facilitator MUST complete and document this wrap up phase before the decision is closed in the {ref}`recording a decision outcome <recording_outcome>` activity.

The decision facilitator SHOULD check and confirm if wrap up is needed in any of the following areas:

- Policies
- The wiki or other SSOT
- Process or technical documentation
- Financial forecast 
- Xero or other third-party software
- Terms of employment
