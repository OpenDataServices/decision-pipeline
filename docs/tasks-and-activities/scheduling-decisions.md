Scheduling a decision
=====================

## How to schedule a consent decision

1. Establish a date when the decision will take place. Care should be taken to respect the conditions for "reasonable notice" in the company rules.
2. In the decision ticket, change the status to "Decision Scheduled" and the "Decision Start Date" and the "Decision End Date" to the relevant dates. Remove any due date.
3. Check that the "decision type" in the issue matches the decision type that is scheduled.
4. Set "Decision Link" to the relevant issue or poll if this exists, or do so when the issue or poll is created.

## When to schedule a decision

``` {warning}
There is no standard approach to scheduling decisions.<br><br> The following information is offered as guidance. The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.
```

Decision sponsors may wish to consider:

- Whether a decision would benefit from a rapid cycle of testing via a consent process or whether a decision needs a longer process of consent-building, education and refinement.
- Whether a decision is "approaching consensus" and would therefore benefit from being tested by a decision-making process. 

### Pre-scheduling decisions

The "Event" field can be used to pre-schedule a decision for a particular event, e.g. an OGM. This is useful if an important decision is in-progress and expected to be ready for a particular event.
