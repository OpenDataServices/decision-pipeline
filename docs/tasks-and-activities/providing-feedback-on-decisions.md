Providing feedback on decisions
===============================

``` {warning}
There is no agreed level of engagement required from Members in decision-making other than that provided for in our Company Rules. The Decision Pipeline is predicated on an agreement that Members will engage with the substance of decisions when asked to do so but is not prescriptive about what this means. The following information is offered as guidance. The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.

Providing asynchronous feedback on decisions at the appropriate stage. Decisions at this stage will have a specific status in the pipeline.
