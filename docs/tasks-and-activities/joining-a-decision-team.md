Joining a decision team
=======================

Any Member or employee of the co-op may join a decision team, at any point in the decision process, if they wish to do so.

Joining a decision may be particularly appropriate if you:

- Have a particular interest in a decision; or,
- Hold a strong opinion on the outcome of a decision; or,
- Have skills, experiences or  that would lead to a better decision; or,
- Have the capacity to work on shaping a decision; or,
- Want to gain experience of decision-making and consensus-building processes.

Joining a decision team means that you will take an active and responsible role in a particular decision (see {ref}`How to use the decision pipeline as decision team member<as_a_decision_team_member>`).

If you just want input into a decision then a {ref}`stakeholder<as_a_stakeholder>` role may be more appropriate. 

### How to join a decision team

1. Inform the decision sponsor or another decision team member.
2. Add yourself to the Decision Team field of the {ref}`decision ticket<decision_ticket>`.
