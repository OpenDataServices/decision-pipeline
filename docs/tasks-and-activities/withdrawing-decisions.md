Withdrawing a decision
=====================

``` {warning}
There is no shared understanding of when and if a potential decision should be withdrawn. The following information is offered as guidance. The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.
```

```{note}
A decision sponsor stopping a decision makes a valuable contribution to the co-op using its time and resources well.
```

Decision sponsors may wish to consider the following:

- Whether significant or unanticipated opposition has emerged in the course of shaping the decision that makes it unlikely the decision will pass in its current form. (Either a total withdrawal or a new decision may be appropriate in this case.)
- Whether internal or external circumstances have changed sufficiently to undermine the original logic for the decision.
- Whether the assumptions of the decision hold up after shaping the decision and building supporting information.
- Whether any better ideas have emerged in the course of developing the decision.
- Whether there are more effective uses of the sponsor's, team's and Members' time than pushing through the current decision.
