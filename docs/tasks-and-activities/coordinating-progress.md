Coordinating progress on a decision
===================================

``` {warning}
There is no standardised way of coordinating the work of a decision team, input from members and the preparation of information to support decision-making.
<br><br>The following information is offered as guidance. The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.
```

Decision sponsors may wish to consider:

- Establishing regular check-ins with the decision team.
- Establishing ownership of relevant documents and tasks.
- Setting internal deadlines for tasks.
- Communicating regularly with those outside the decision team about when and how they will need input and feedback.
- If and how the decision team would benefit from external resources and/or advice to progress a decision.
