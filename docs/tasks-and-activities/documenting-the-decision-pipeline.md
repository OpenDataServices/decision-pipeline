META: Documenting the Decision Pipeline
=================================

The reference documentation for the Decision Pipeline is this repository.

Documentation should:

- Reflect practice not theory, and should be updated if the two start to diverge.
- Avoid false certainty.
- Be explicit about the absence of standardised practices or agreements.
- Be versioned.
- Not be used to make changes without communicating those changes.
