Delegating a decision
=====================

## Recording that a decision has been delegated

1. Update the decision ticket with a record of who the decision has been delegated to and how and when the decision to delegate was made.
2. Add the ticket where the delegated decision-making is taking place as a linked issue.  
3. Set the status of the decision to 'Delegated'.

Note that "Delegated" is a closed issue status so no further reporting via the decision pipeline should be expected.

``` {warning}
There is no shared understanding on if and when a decision should be delegated and no standardised way of delegating decisions from the Membership as a whole. The following information is offered as guidance. The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.

## How to delegate

### Members

Members may wish to consider:

- If any conditions on delegation are appropriate.
- If any reporting to Members is expected.
- How they expect to be involved in a delegated decision.

### Decision sponsors

Decision sponsors and teams may wish to consider:

- The conditions under which they might need to revert to Members.
- How they will communicate the progress and conclusion of a delegated decision.
- Which activities described in the decision pipeline documentation will be necessary even if the final decision is delegated.

## When to delegate

Members may wish to consider:

- Whether the expertise and interest in a particular decision is concentrated in a small group.
- Whether delegating to a smaller group or retaining decision-making with the entire membership is proportionate to the impact of the decision.
- Whether careful delegation to a smaller group can retain the desirable features of participative decision-making.
