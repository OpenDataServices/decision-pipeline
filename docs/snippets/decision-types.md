Regular decision updates should be issued in advance of every fortnightly team meeting. 

### Triggers for a decision update

A regular update MUST be issued for a decision if:

- The status of the decision has changed.
- The substance of the decision has changed.
- The planned decision type, event or schedule has changed.
- The decision sponsor or team has changed.
- There has been material progress on or change to any aspect of the decision summary or supporting information.
- An update has been requested by a member.

A regular update should highlight any relevant changes to the decision ticket and decision summary, which members are expected to read. A regular update may also highlight any supporting information that members are required to read.

### Lack of updates

Updates are not mandatory but a lack of updates may be an indication that a decision is {ref}`on hold<on_hold>` or should be {ref}`withdrawn<withdrawing_a_decision>`.
