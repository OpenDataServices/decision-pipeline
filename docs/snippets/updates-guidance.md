In general:

- Early stage decisions will provide summary information on a decision only.
- Summary information will become more detailed and certain as a decision progresses through the pipeline.
- Decisions at a more advanced stage MAY provide supporting material. 
- Supporting material SHOULD be tailored to the complexity and potential impact of the decision.
- Supporting material SHOULD be digestible and useful to members in making the right decision.
