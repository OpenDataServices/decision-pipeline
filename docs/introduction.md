The Decision Pipeline is a mechanism for representing the progress of all member-level decisions from early-stage refinement work through to acceptance or rejection by the Membership.

The Decision Pipeline consists of three linked components:

1. An **agile board** that tracks individual decisions as tickets through each stage of their lifecycle. The agile board will be a best efforts representation of the Decision Pipeline at any one time, and act as a common co-ordination mechanism for many of the tasks and activities that go into making decisions happen.   
2. A **reciprocal agreement** that {term}`decision facilitators<decision facilitator>` will provide regular updates on the progress and substance of decisions, while Members will stay up-to-date with progress and engage with the substance of decisions when needed.
3. A **conceptual framework** that describes how decisions progress, comprising decision statuses, roles and responsibilities, and tasks and activities.
