### Asynchronous updates on decisions

### Agenda

#### Agile board review

#### Structure agenda

New decisions SHOULD be introduced via a structured agenda item when they first appear, to allow for early feedback.

Decision sponsors or any employee/member MAY request an agenda item on a particular decision if needed to identify steps to advance a decision.
