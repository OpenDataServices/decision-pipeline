## Guidance on information

```


```{list-table} Details of information for an in draft decision
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 3
* - Information
  - Description
* - Decision sponsor
  - A single decision sponsor MUST have been identified for all decisions in draft.
* - Decision summary 
  - A high-level outline of the predicted decision, now refined through the drafting process. The description is likely to include a summary of the likely benefits and impact and any stakeholders who have been identified in scoping the decision. It may include a draft proposal.<br><br>Any draft decision documentation and supporting documents or data must be accessible through the ticket where work is taking place.
* - Due date
  - The *predicted* date when a decision-making process will start should be updated as this becomes clearer through the drafting process.
* - Decision type
  - The drafting process should lead to an indication of what type of decision-making process will be appropriate.
* - Event
  - It may be appropriate to schedule the decision alongside a particular event. The drafting process will reveal how realistic this is.
* - Decision team
  - The drafting process may lead to the discovery of new skill requirements for the team or lead to interested parties joining the team.
* - Parent issue
  - A link to the main ticket where work on the decision is progressing. Transparency is important at the "in draft" stage as work may progress quickly, meaning that summary information can become outdated between updates.

```{note} **Example decision**: increasing basic pay<br>

At the "in draft" stage a decision summary on pay may be start to become more detailed as implementation details are added, an initial proposal drafted, supporting information is gathered and opinions from stakeholders are incorporated.
<br><br>
An "in draft" decision summary for a proposal to increase basic pay may start to look like:
- A draft proposal to raise pay by the value of inflation, (defined as CPIH in the month the decision is made).
- Some bullet points outlining the drivers for increasing basic pay.
- Some bullet points outlining the risks of increasing basic pay and the risks of not acting.
- A draft spreadsheet showing the financial impact.
