```


```{list-table} Details of information for an in draft decision
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 3
* - Information
  - Description
* - Decision summary 
  - A very high-level description of the predicted decision, now refined through the drafting process. The description is likely to include a summary of the likely benefits and impact and any stakeholders who have been identified in scoping the decision.<br><br>Any draft decision documentation and supporting documents or data must be accessible through the ticket where work is taking place.
* - Decision date
  - A *predicted* date when a decision-making process will start. This is important for planning engagement and identifying deadlines.
* - Parent issue
  - A link to the main ticket where work on the decision is progressing. At the emerging stage summary information provided to Members is likely to be limited, so other transparency mechanisms are important.  
```

```{note} **Example decision**: increasing basic pay<br>

At the emerging stage a decision summary on pay may be as simple as e.g. “Whether to grant employees an inflation-linked pay rise in line with our policy, in light of the material increase in inflation”. Stakeholders may have been identified from first principles, e.g. all employees (who will have an opinion on how much they are paid), Finance Group (who will have an opinion on costs), Business Development Group (who will have an opinion on the knock-on effects on pricing).
