Emerging
========

A emerging decision is a decision that an individual or group predicts will be escalated to the membership. An emerging decision is likely to be an "idea" or "in scoping" and have few implementation details and little supporting documentation.

## Guidance on information

``` {include} ../../../snippets/status-information.md
```


```{list-table} Details of information for an Emerging decision
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 3
* - Information
  - Description
* - Decision sponsor
  - A decision sponsor is not required for emerging decisions but a single decision sponsor MUST be identified in order for work to progress.
* - Decision summary 
  - A very high-level {ref}`outline<decision_summary>` of the predicted decision. This may include a very rough proposal, a summary of the likely benefits and impact and any stakeholders who have been identified in scoping the decision.
* - Decision date
  - A *predicted* date when a decision-making process will start. This is important for planning engagement and identifying deadlines.
* - Parent issue
  - A link to the main ticket where work on the decision is progressing. At the "emerging" stage summary information provided to Members is likely to be limited, so other transparency mechanisms are important.  
```

```{note} **Example decision**: increasing basic pay<br>

At the emerging stage a decision summary on pay may be as simple as e.g. “Grant employees an inflation-linked pay rise in line with our policy, in light of the material increase in inflation”.<br><br> In the first few days after the decision is raised, a decision sponsor is identified and a decision team starts to form. Stakeholders are identified from first principles, e.g. all employees (who will have an opinion on how much they are paid), Finance Group (who will have an opinion on costs), Business Development Group (who will have an opinion on the knock-on effects on pricing).
