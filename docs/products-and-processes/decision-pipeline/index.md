A representation of all planned and current decisions that the whole membership must make or choose to delegate, place on hold or withdraw.

The pipeline is a Plan.io project with an associated Agile Board. Each potential decision is represented by a single ticket.

The pipeline shows the progress of a decision from early-stage refinement work through to acceptance or rejection by the membership.
