Decision summary
================

``` {warning}
There is no standardised way of providing members with proposals or supporting information. The following information is offered as guidance. The Decision Pipeline includes a regular {ref}`update process<updating_products_processes_and_activities>` through which individual products, processes and activities may be updated or identified for improvements.
```

A decision summary will vary depending on the complexity and impact of the decision. Small decisions may require only a paragraph or so of text. Larger decisions may require a paper for members, with supporting information in various formats. 

A decision summary may require some or all of the components listed below.

* - Component
  - Description
* - Proposal text
  - The text of a decision that Members will vote on, as currently understood by the decision team.

* - Budget
  - An outline budget for a decision with cost or capacity implications.
