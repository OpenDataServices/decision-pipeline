Principles
==========

The Decision Pipeline is based on the following principles:

The Decision Pipeline is **opinionated and prescriptive** about a small number of things:

- Ensuring that decisions in progress are visible. 
- Standardising how the progress of decisions is represented and updated.
- Naming and assigning responsibilities and expectations.

The Decision Pipeline is **unopinionated and flexible** about a larger number of things, including:

- How work on decisions is organised and progressed.
- How decisions are made.
- How proposals are presented to members.

At the same time, the Decision Pipeline provides a conceptual framework for understanding decision-making as it is currently practised and for changing those practices in the future. It does this by:

- Representing the activities that go into shaping, progressing and resolving a decision.
- Documenting a lack of standardisation, documentation or agreement where appropriate.
- Building in review and revision of the product, processes and activities to named responsibilities.
